# Paper Title:
Anh Tuan Nguyen, Tung Thanh Nguyen, Tien N. Nguyen, David Lo, Chengnian Sun. 2012. Duplicate Bug Report Detection with a Combination of Information Retrieval and Topic Modeling. (Proceedings of the 27th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering)

# Keywords:
ii1. Duplicate bug report: When many developers/testers file a bug report having same technical problems but they use different terminology or styles and write about different phenomenon to write about the same issue(s) that is classified as a duplicate bug report.
ii2. Information retrieval-Information retrieval (IR) is the activity of obtaining information resources relevant to an information need from a collection of information resources.
ii3. Term frequency- Inverse documents frequency (Tf-Idf)-In information retrieval term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection.
ii4. Topic Model - In machine learning and natural language processing, a topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract topics that occur in a collection of documents. Topic modeling is a frequently used text-mining tool for discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body.

# Notes:
iii1. Motivational Statements: Among several automated detection approaches, text-based information retrieval (IR) approaches have been shown to outperform others in term of both accuracy and time efficiency. However, those IR-based approaches do not detect well the duplicate reports on the same technical issues written in different descriptive terms.
