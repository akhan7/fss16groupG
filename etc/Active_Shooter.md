## Two things not to do during an active shooter event
1. Don't assume someone else is going to call the authorities. Find a safe place where you can initiate the call, be persistent as the lines may be jammed. Calmly state where you are and what's happening.

2. If a law enforcement officer approaches you, don't point, don't scream or yell and don't present any sort of a perceived threat to them. Be quiet and compliant.
