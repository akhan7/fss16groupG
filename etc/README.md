#### Workshop Code

* **FSMS** - Finite State Machines
  ##### Modelling Finite State Machines.
  > In this workshop we code up a small world model in python. This model is called Snowrush. The rules are as follows:
  * You start of at home with some energy "E".
  * It is snowing outside and you go out.
  * Once outside, there are three possible scenarios.
    * You step on snow, slip and fall down and loose some energy. 
    * You step on grass, take rest and gain some energy.
    * You fall in a pit and die.


* **GA** - Genetic Algorithm
  > In this workshop we will code up a genetic algorithm for a simple mathematical optimization problem.
  Genetic Algorithm is a
    * Meta-heuristic
    * Inspired by Natural Selection
    * Traditionally works on binary data. Can be adopted for other data types as well.

* **POM3GA** -
> ##### Optimizing Real World Problems 
  In this workshop we will code up a model called POM3 and optimize it using the GA we developed in the first workshop.
  POM3 is a software estimation model like XOMO for Software Engineering. It is based on Turner and Boehmâ€™s model of agile       development. It compares traditional plan-based approaches to agile-based approaches in requirements prioritization. It         describes how a team decides which requirements to implement next. POM3 reveals requirements incrementally in random order,     with which developers plan their work assignments. These assignments are further adjusted based on current cost and priority   of requirement. POM3 is a realistic model which takes more runtime than standard mathematical models(2-100ms, not 0.006-        0.3ms)
