*What Makes a Good Bug Report? ,Thomas Zimmermann, Member, IEEE, Rahul Premraj, Nicolas Bettenburg, Member, IEEE,Sascha Just, Member, IEEE, Adrian Schro ̈ter, Member, IEEE, and Cathrin Weiss*

###Keywords - 

####ii1.Testing and Debugging-
 Software testing is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or service under test. Debugging is the process of finding and resolving of defects that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system.
 
####ii2.Distribution-
 Distribution is the process of making a product or service available for use or consumption by a consumer or business user, using direct means, or using indirect means with intermediaries.

####ii3.Maintenance and Enhancement-
 Software maintenance in software engineering is the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes. Software enhancement is a proposed or newly added software feature

####ii4.Human Factors-
 Human factors is the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system, and the profession that applies theory, principles, data and methods to design in order to optimize human well-being and overall system performance

###Notes-  

####iii1. Data Sets – 
The data set used for this paper can be found on the Computer Society Digital Library at http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/TSE.2010.63. The authors have considered 2 files. One of them contains raw bug reports rated by developers and reporters. Results obtained from these reports have been used for their experiments. 

####iii2. Related Work –
The work related to the one explained is by Hooimeijer and Weimer who built a descriptive model for the lifetime of a bug report. They assumed that the “time until resolved” is a good indicator for the quality of a bug report. 

####iii3. Future work – 
 The writers have mentioned that their CUEZILLA can be extended to identify problematic contents such as errors in steps to reproduce and code samples in order to warn the reporter in these situations impact on other research. The writers have made their data and scripts publicly available so that further work can be carried out using it.

####iii4. Results – 
 Most significant results found by the writers was  
•	Bug reports containing stack traces get fixed sooner.
(APACHE/ECLIPSE/MOZILLA)

•	Bug reports that are easier to read have lower
lifetimes. (APACHE/ECLIPSE/MOZILLA)

•	Including code samples in your bug report increases
the chances of it getting fixed. (MOZILLA)

###Improvements-

iv1. Lack of sufficient pictorial representation-
 The author should have added more pictorial representations of their survey, experiments and results. This would have made the paper more impactful.

iv2. Could have added a flow diagram at few places-
 There could have been flow diagrams at few places which could explain their work and process. This would have made the paper easier to understand.
