Keywords: 
Duplicate bug reports: When many developers/testers file a bug report having same technical problems but they use different terminology or styles and write about different phenomenon to write about the same issue(s) that is classified as a duplicate bug report.
Topic model: In machine learning and natural language processing, a topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents.
Machine learning: Machine learning is a subfield of computer science that is closely related to (and often overlaps   with) computational statistics; a discipline which also focuses in prediction-making through the use of computers.
Deduplication: In computing deduplication is a specialized compression technique for eliminating duplicate copies of repeating data
