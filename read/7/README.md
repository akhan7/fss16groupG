Paper Title:

Auto-completing Bug Reports for Android Applications

Keywords:

ii1.Bug reports:A bug report is something that stores all information needed to document, report and fix problems occurred in a software or on a website.

ii2.android:Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on the Linux kernel

ii3.reproduction steps: steps to produce its kind

ii4.auto-completion: Autocomplete, or auto completion, is a feature in which an application predicts the rest of the work the user is doing. eg:typing words.

Note:

iii1.motivational statements:The modern software development landscape has seen a shift in focus toward mobile applications as tablets and smartphones near ubiquitous adoption. Due to this trend, the complexity of these \apps" has been increasing, making development
and maintenance challenging. Additionally, current bug tracking systems are not able to effectively support construction of reports with actionable information that directly lead to a bug's resolution. To address the need for an improved reporting system, the authors have introduced a solution, called FUSION, that helps users auto-complete reproduction steps in bug reports for mobile apps.

iii2.Related Work:A past survey of open source developers conducted by 'A. G. Koru and J. Tian. Defect handling in medium and large open source projects. IEEE Softw.,21(4):54{61, July 2004.' has shown that only about 50% of developers believe bug reports are always complete. Previous studies have also shown that the information most useful to developers is often the most diffcult for reporters to provide and that the lack of this information is a major reason behind nonreproducible bug reports . Diffculty providing such information, especially reproduction steps, is compounded in the context of mobile applications due to their complex event-driven and GUI-based nature.

iii3.Conclusion: The FUSION approach takes advantage of program analysis techniques and the event-driven nature of Android applications, in order to help auto-complete the reproduction steps for bugs. Results from the evaluation of this show that FUSION is able to produce more reproducible bug reports than traditional issue tracking systems.

iii4.Future Work:In order to promote transparency for this work and facilitate researchers working on similar projects, the authors have provided the full dataset collected during the empirical studies conducted to evaluate FUSION. This dataset contains all of the time, reproduction, user experience, and user preference results from their study. In future work, they aim to improve their DFS engine through supporting more gestures, to explore adding more specifc program information in reports for quicker/automatic fault localization, and to use FUSION as a tool for reporting feature requests.

Improvements:

iv1.The authors could have added separate section for related work so that it is easier to understand, instead of mentioning them in the middle.

iv2.The authors could also have added a separate section for future work instead of combining it with conclusion so that the purpose of both these secions are clearly understood.
