Paper Title-
Auto-completing Bug Reports for Android Applications

Keywords-
Bug reports:A bug report is something that stores all information needed to document, report and fix problems occurred in a software or on a website.
android:Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on the Linux kernel
reproduction steps: steps to produce its kind
auto-completion: Autocomplete, or auto completion, is a feature in which an application predicts the rest of the work the user is doing. eg:typing words.

Note:

Conclusion: Prior research highlights an inherent lexical gap that exists
between reporters of bugs and developers. To help overcome
this, we introduced FUSION, a novel bug reporting
approach, that takes advantage of program analysis techniques
and the event-driven nature of Android applications,
in order to help auto-complete the reproduction steps for
bugs. Results from our comprehensive evaluation show FUSION
is able to produce more reproducible bug reports than
traditional issue tracking systems.
Future Work:In order to promote transparency for this work and facilitate
researchers working on similar projects, we provide the
full dataset collected during the empirical studies conducted
to evaluate FUSION. This dataset contains all of the time,
reproduction, user experience, and user preference results
from our study. For convenience, we offer the results in either
.xlsx or .csv format. The excel workbook is broken
into sheets each with different results outlined on each sheet,
and the .csv representation is broken into separate files each
containing different results.
In future work, we aim to improve
our DFS engine through supporting more gestures, to
explore adding more specic program information in reports
for quicker/automatic fault localization, and to use FUSION
as a tool for reporting feature requests.
