#Time table Scheduling 

### Why?
There are certain class of problems called NP Hard and one of the ways of solving these problems
is through randomization and by the use of meta heuristics which is what 
We've been learning throughout the semester in **`CSC591 ASE`**

### Problem Statement
>Time table scheduling problem is a multi constrained , NP Hard , combinatorial 
optimization problem. One of the derivative of this problem is Examination
time tabling problem which takes in a list of courses offered by a university and schedules
the list of students enrolled in these courses and schedules the exams in
such a way that there are no overlaps for a student and the exams
are scheduled as far as possible within a specified window of dates.


### Description
    Decisions : 
        * A set of time slots (contiguous) T
        * A set of courses C
        * A set of Students S
        * A set of student enrollments E (Ideally a pair of Student Number and Course ID)

    Objectives :
